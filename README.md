# CryptoClustering

This is a unsupervised learning machine learning project in which the data was prepared, the best value for k was found by the origninal scaled dataframe, cluster cryptocurrencies with the k-means values, optimize clusters with principal component analysis, the best value for K was foumd with the PCA data and cluster cryptocurrencies with k-means values with the PCA data.
